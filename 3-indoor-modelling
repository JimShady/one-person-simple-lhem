## Loop through day tables again
## Read them in
## Do 'Something' for indoor exposure
## This could be turn to spatial points, then extract an I/O ratio from a shapefile?
## Could be use an I/O ratio, depending on the house type, that you've created from Shannon's measurements?
## Could be extracting a concentration based upon a profile that has been created from Shannon's measurements?
## Could be your own mass balance model?
## Write the day tables out. Again, I would make a new file. Perhaps better naming convention but something like
## 'day_tables_after_io_model/3454353.Rdata'
