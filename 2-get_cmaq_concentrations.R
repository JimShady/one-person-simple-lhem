## Go through each of the day tables

## Smoething like.... in a loop ....

## Import table
## Turn to spatial points data frame
## Look at the date the day is for
## download from C3 the correct netcdf files (define pollutants here?)
## Format/turn netcdf files into raster files
## Extract concentrations, by hour, from the netcdf files
## store back in the day tables
## write day tables back to a file. Suggest new file and folder i.e
## 'day_tables_plus_pollutants/345345344.Rdata'
